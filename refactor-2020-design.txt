Major refactor (2020) design:

Folder structure:

data
notebooks
out
scripts
src
    common
    quali
        LinearModel
        DataProcessor
        Facade
        MonteCarlo
    race
        EloRaceModel
        EloRaceModelGenerator
        MonteCarlo

NOTE: most important scripts should still exist at root level!

Quali model:

Compose into several classes:

Quali model: contains the mathematical operations that define a model
    - Only this object is required to generate predictions for a new GP
Quali data processor: abstract helper class
    - Contains method for actually running the model generator, returns all kinds of analytics. Called by facades below
Facades:
    - Each its own class, each can return the model (aka race model generator)
    - Model Generator: just creates and returns the model
    - Dataset Generator: generates dataset of entries, errors and results
    - Predictions Generator: generates list of predictions

This way, logic can be encapsulated

Separate creating an optimal model from generating predictions
    - Optional model generator is its own script, included in main workflow
    - Save function saves the data processor only!
